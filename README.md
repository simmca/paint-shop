Front-end mockup of a paint shop website. Built using Visual Studio Code. Utilizing HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This is the front end for my capstone project with Tech Elevator. It will link to a backend database and have a fully functional cart in the final version.

Current features include a working search bar, working message for adding items to cart, working description when clicking the product name, and the site is mobile ready.
